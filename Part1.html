<p> Data gathering Artificial Intelligence can also be used maliciously to gather users private information without them knowing. Then selling the private personal information to third parties. It is important that the data gathering artificial intelligence of these mega corporations be closely monitored, so that they do not breach the user’s privacy. This has been a recurring problem worldwide. In the last decade the use of social media has skyrocketed. Social media is used to connect people all over the world and also to give each person a platform to express their opinions. Of course there is a darker side to social media. By using social media many user’s sensitive personal data is gathered without them knowing, data that can easily be used maliciously. Some users do not understand that their rights to privacy are being breached. A user’s information act is protected by the Federal Privacy Act of 1988 in Australia. But because the internet is world wide many malicious organisations are able to use sensitive data for money making purposes. This includes blackmailing users or selling the data to larger corporations. User data is typically gathered by advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. An example of this is the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, Cambridge Analytica was caught illegally using Facebook’s user data for advertising. The US Senate held a hearing where Facebook was accused of not protecting the data of their users and profiting from the theft of user data. Another huge problem with privacy on social media is politics, because there are so many people that use social media, large companies and even governments can easily spread misinformation to unsuspecting users that take it at face value. The Chinese and Russian government have both been accused of this. In 2003 Russian social media accounts were accused of posting anti-democratic propaganda. Social media has caused a large social shift that has led to issues in data security and privacy, as well as conflicts between governments and political groups. These problems are hard to tackle and will take an extended period of time to fix. The solution is to inform users on the inner workings of social media and how sensitive data can be collected and teach them to be more protective with their personal data.

  Computing is constantly becoming more complex and it is changing the world. Faster chips and softwares system updates are happening everyday, ever growing the spread of machine learning algorithms.
The start of the computing revolution was more than 80 years ago, we have seen the change in size, power and speed. An ever increasing amount. In February, 2019, Facebook’s head of A.I. research, Yann LeCun, gave a keynote speech at the ISSCC (International Solid State Circuits Conference) in San Francisco, one of the most successful computer chip conferences in history. At ISSCC, Le Cun gave an example of the importance of computer technology to A.I. development and research. “Hardware capabilities and software tools both motivate and limit the type of ideas that AI researchers will imagine and will allow themselves to pursue". “The tools at our disposal fashion our thoughts more than we care to admit.” Said LeCun, from this we can easily see that is already the case. The increased use of deep learning algorithms, originating in 2006, came about not only because of the rise in need for data storage, and new technologies in machine learning, and also because of increasing computing power. In particular, an increasing use of GPU’s (graphics processing units). Especially from Nvidia, this led to an increasing parallelization of computers. That also increased the possibility of training larger networks in the past. This new technology in the 1980s of  “parallel distributed processing,” where nodes of an AI network. Are trained at the same time, finally became possible.

<h3> Question 7 </br> Facebook is developing a virtual reality headset called Oculus Rift. Describe what Oculus Rift is and outline its purpose. (3marks) </h3>
<p>
  The Oculus Rift is a new type of VR (virtual reality) technology. Manufactured by Oculus VR which is owned by Facebook. Oculus was bought by Facebook in 2014 for $2 Billion, Zuckerberg the owner and founder of Facebook saw a successful future for virtual reality technology and took a gamble on Oculus. He believed that VR was the future of gaming, education and medicinal research. In 2014 the Oculus was merely a prototype that had been shown at the E3 gaming convention. The Oculus Rift is a headset with a pair of screens that are side by side, one screen for each of the user’s eyes. A lense is placed on top of each screen. The lense focuses and reshapes the images so that the user can clearly see inside the virtual world. The image that the user sees is called a stereoscopic three dimensional image. Stereoscopic imaging is used to create a three dimensional effect on a two dimensional image. It is used to create an illusion of depth using the user’s stereopsis or perception of depth therefore being three dimensional. The Rift also uses motion sensing technology to measure the pitch, yaw and roll of the Rift. This simulates the user’s head movements inside the 3D virtual reality world allowing them to move their head and move around. The Oculus Rift also comes with a pair of controllers that are held in the users hands. These controllers also have motion sensing technology and various buttons allowing the user to interact with the virtual three dimensional environment. The Oculus Rift has quickly become the most popular consumer grade virtual reality technology, despite only being released in 2016. We can see the exponentially increasing popularity of VR technology by the ever growing amount of technology companies now creating their own versions. Currently the top three most successful VR companies are; Oculus, Sony and HTC, who all have their own version of this new VR technology. The Oculus Rift can be used for a range of different recreational and professional applications. Millions of people have already bought an Oculus Rift for personal, recreational, medical and educational use, because it allows interaction with a virtual 3D environment that can easily simulate real world situations. The Rift creates a great sense of immersion for all of its users.

<h3> Question 8 </br> 8. Explain how Oculus Rift could be used in the future in the below fields and discuss the potential benefits and issues in each area:
</br> a. Education; (4 marks) </h3>
<p>
  The Oculus Rift is already being used for learning in several applications. It allows teachers and professors to use game-based learning, to develop special skills and remote tours and learning. Virtual reality is able to simulate realistic scenarios without the risk of the situation. VR allows students to complete dangerous specialised tasks without any risk of injury. Due to this the virtual reality technology is also capable of teaching students practical skills. Google’s dream labs carried out an experiment that used VR to train a set of students for a specialised task while another set of students used a video tutorial. The results concluded that the set of students using the VR learned faster and more efficiently than the other set of students. Another application for VR technology in education is the use of it in special education. An example of this is the The Jackson School in Victoria, Australia. This preparatory school specialises in special education. The Jackson School has started using the Oculus Rift to help it’s students with hands-on learning. For instance, take a virtual tour through a museum. It’s noted that using VR technology to help the students to meditate, many of whom have some form of autism. This allows the students to stay calm throughout the day, enabling them to learn effectively.
A more recent application is using the Oculus for remote learning due to the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Using VR technology for remote learning allows students to enter a virtual classroom, rather than use a video conferencing system like Skype, Zoom or Microsoft teams. Being in a virtual classroom allows science and technology students to conduct experiments and have a more interactive learning experience, whereas other online learning applications do not allow this or make it hard for students to interact with these experiments.
 recreational and professional applications. Millions of people have already bought an Oculus Rift for personal, recreational, medical and educational use, because it allows interaction with a virtual 3D environment that can easily simulate real world situations. The Rift creates a great sense of immersion for all of its users.

<h3> b. Medicine; and (4 marks) </h3>
<p>
  Virtual reality technology is becoming more prevalent in the medicinal research and healthcare industry. The market for VR technologies in healthcare is expected to grow to over $3.7 billion by the end of 2020, according to a report done by the Global Industry Analysts. Another report reveals that the VR market in medicine could grow to over $5.1 Billions by the end of 2025. This new technology could potentially revolutionize the medicinal research and the healthcare industry, with applications ranging from diagnostics, training and treatment, especially when working with mentally challenged patients. A study found that VR could be actively used in detecting Alzehmiers’s disease, earlier than traditional methods. There are over 342,000 cases of alzehmiers in Australia. A neuroscientist found that using VR can allow easier discovery and monitoring of the disease. VR can also help patients who may be bed ridden, unable to leave their rooms, get outside and experience life. This would greatly increase their mental health and may distract them from the situation they face. Virtual reality technology can also be used in training nurses and doctors, to allow them to perform in specific situations. In recent times, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some general practitioners and doctors have used virtual reality to communicate with their patients without the risk of compromising their safety from the disease.

<h3>c. Politics. (4 marks)</h3>
<p>
  Technology and politics are becoming increasingly linked, we now see widespread political activism taking place on the internet, through social media sites. It has never been easier to spread political opinions with such a large number of people, who may agree or disagree. Politicians are constantly adapting to new types of media and technology, this further connects them with their supporters and voter-base. Examples of this are Trump’s use of twitter, JFK’s early use of television in the 1960’s and Roosevelt's “Fireside Chats” in the 1930’s. The adoption of modern communication technology has never been more important for politicians in recent years. Virtual reality is no exception, recently the Obama administration used VR technology to former staff of the New Zealand government, giving them a personal 3D virtual reality tour of the white house. The use of VR in politics has not only been used for house tours. The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon used VR to virtually travel to ten different countries who had recently been affected by natural disaster or wars. These ‘trips’ gave viewers a glimpse of more difficult living conditions that some people have to deal with on our planet. VR is also being used recently because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, virtual reality allows politicians to meet and discuss issues remotely while still being face to face.
