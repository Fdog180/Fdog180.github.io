  <h2> You will create a series of examination style questions and answers on the topic of Multimedia Systems. You can choose what topic within multimedia systems your questions will be on.
These will also be hosted on your website. <br> </br>

You will be assessed on the accuracy of the questions relative to the weighting, the clarity and appropriateness of the question, and the quality and appropriateness of the sample answer and rubric.
You will make questions that are significantly different from one another and will have the following weightings.
</h2>

<h3>Question 1 (2 marks) </br>
Describe the key features of a multimedia system and how it can aid in education.

  </h3>
  <table style="width:10%; solid black; padding-right:15px; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px">
  <tr>
    <th> Criteria </th>
    <th> Mark </th>
  <tr>
    <td >Describes the effectiveness of a multimedia system</td>
    <td >1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Describes how it may be used</td>
    <td>1</td>
</tr>
  </table>

<p>Multimedia systems can be used to benefit learning effectiveness. Using a multimedia system as a learning environment allows a hands on learning experience and allows students to better understand the topic.
  </p>

  <h3>Question 2 (2 marks) </br>
  Who are the participants in a multimedia system designed to run a bank?

    </h3>
    <table style="width:10%; solid black; padding-right:15px; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px">
    <tr>

    <tr>
      <td >Names two participants</td>
      <td >1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Names two more participants</td>
      <td>1</td>
  </tr>
    </table>

  <p>Participants for this type of system include; the banks occupants, their clients, money delivery systems and emergency services.
    </p>

    <h3>Question 3 (3 marks) </br>
    What are the differences between copyright and data integrity as issues when it comes to a multimedia systems development?

      </h3>
      <table style="width:10%; solid black; padding-right:15px; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px">
      <tr>
        <th> Criteria </th>
        <th> Mark </th>
      <tr>
        <td >Describes what copyright is and it’s issues</td>
        <td >1.5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Describes what data integrity is and it’s issues</td>
        <td>1.5</td>
    </tr>
      </table>

    <p>Participants for this type of system include; the banks occupants, their clients, money delivery systems and emergency services.
      </p>

      <h3>Question 4 (4 marks) </br>
      Describe two differences between multimedia and print presentations

        </h3>
        <table style="width:10%; solid black; padding-right:15px; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px">
        <tr>
          <th> Criteria </th>
          <th> Mark </th>
        <tr>
          <td >Describes one difference between multimedia and print presentations</td>
          <td >1.5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Describes two difference between multimedia and print presentations</td>
          <td>1.5</td>
      </tr>
        </table>

      <p>There are a number of differences between multimedia and print presentations, these include; The interactive nature of a multimedia presentation. Interactivity allows the user to be able to take immediate action and modify the processes involved whereas a print presentation cannot be changed once it has been printed. Another difference is that a multimedia system can be implemented into a computer system through wired and wireless connections, whereas print can only be given if scanned into pdf format.
        </p>


        <h3>Question 5 (5 marks) </br>
        A multimedia system is the accumulation of several elements. Sound is a major component when it comes to multimedia. How is the sound component of a multimedia system recorded and stored. Also what are the other major components of a multimedia system?

          </h3>
          <table style="width:10%; solid black; padding-right:15px; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px">
          <tr>
            <th> Criteria </th>
            <th> Mark </th>
          <tr>
            <td >Names at least 3 other components</td>
            <td >1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Describes sample size</td>
            <td>2</td>
        </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Describes sample rate</td>
            <td>2</td>
          </tr>
          </table>

        <p>Text, hypertext, numbers, video and animation are all major components of multimedia systems. Sound undergoes a process of digitisation where it is sampled and converted into a binary source. The amplitude of the wave is converted into binary numbers by cutting the wave and measuring it. A sample size refers to the number of bits that are used to store a sample from the analog wave. Sampling rate refers to the amount of time the wave is sampled and converted into binary. Alternatively the sound can be stored as a MIDI file. A MIDI file is where information is stored and transmitted contains data about each sound; time of play, loudness and note identification. A synthesiser is needed to translate a MIDI file into audio for the user.
